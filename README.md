# Scoreboard
 Arduino Powered Scoreboard for any game.

I host Game Nights for my friends and family and there are lots of games we play. I have made a few apps to make keeping score easier and more accurate with logic to catch errors. One thing I didn't think about doing was making it easier for everyone to see the scores. If  had a nickle for every time someone asked me what the score was and every time I've announced the score, I'd have a few hundered dollars. One of my friends, I forget which jokingly said I should make a scoreboard like they have at bowling places. Thus I was inspired.

## Research
I did a little research to see how hard it would be to do something because it's been a long time since I've done much with hardware and I came accross this [project](https://www.instructables.com/Remote-Controlled-Arduino-Scoreboard-using-LED-Str/). What I wanted to do was more complicated, but it now seems simple enough.

# Parts Required
- LED Strips
    - To create 7-segment displays
    - Can customize to have negative sign or decimal point
    - Will be creating 2 sizes of 7-segs
- TIP-120's and 220Î© resistors
    - One of each for each LED strip
- Shift Registers
    - One for each 7-seg
- Copper Tape and Electricians Tape
- Arduino or other board
- Interface Connection
    - Mine will use bluetooth in order to connect to an app I will be making
    - Will probably also use IR for testing purposes
